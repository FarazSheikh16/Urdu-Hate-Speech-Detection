## Introduction


Hate speech is an alarming and widespread issue that transcends borders and languages, fostering harmful and offensive behavior on democratic platforms. The sheer volume of data circulating online makes manual filtering an impractical solution, particularly when dealing with low-resource regional languages. In South Asia, Urdu, a language with extensive usage, faces its own set of challenges in combating hate speech effectively.

To address this pressing concern, we present our Hate Speech Detection Model for Urdu. This repository houses a robust and scalable solution designed to identify hate speech and offensive content within text and sentences. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, our model aims to contribute significantly to the mitigation of negative phenomena on democratic platforms where the impact of hate speech is most pronounced.



## Dataset

Our comprehensive dataset, derived from YouTube comments and feedback on E-shopping sites, is meticulously curated and conveniently available in this repository.

## Model Architecture

For the Urdu Hate Speech Detection, we employ a combination of Classic Machine Learning (ML) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, tailored to address the nuances of natural language processing.

### Classic ML Models

Our approach involves utilizing well-established classic ML models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Naive Bayes. These models are trained on carefully engineered features extracted from the Urdu text, allowing them to effectively discern patterns associated with hate speech.

### LSTM Network

In addition to classic ML models, we leverage the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence modeling. The LSTM network is trained on the sequential nature of language, capturing dependencies and contextual information within the Urdu text. This enables our model to grasp the intricacies of hate speech in a more dynamic and context-aware manner.

This hybrid approach, combining the strengths of classic ML models and LSTM networks, enhances the robustness of our Hate Speech Detection model for Urdu. It allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the language, ensuring effective identification of offensive content and contributing to a safer online environment.
