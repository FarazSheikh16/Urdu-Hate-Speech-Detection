## Introduction


Hate speech is an alarming and widespread issue that transcends borders and languages, fostering harmful and offensive behavior on democratic platforms. The sheer volume of data circulating online makes manual filtering an impractical solution, particularly when dealing with low-resource regional languages. In South Asia, Urdu, a language with extensive usage, faces its own set of challenges in combating hate speech effectively.

To address this pressing concern, we present our Hate Speech Detection Model for Urdu. This repository houses a robust and scalable solution designed to identify hate speech and offensive content within text and sentences. By leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, our model aims to contribute significantly to the mitigation of negative phenomena on democratic platforms where the impact of hate speech is most pronounced.



## Dataset

Our comprehensive dataset, derived from YouTube comments and feedback on E-shopping sites, is meticulously curated and conveniently available in this repository.

## Model Architecture

For the Urdu Hate Speech Detection, we applied Classic Machine Learning (ML) models  and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/Urdu-Hate-Speech-Detection.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the specific Notebook you want to use

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on test data using different classic ML models and also using LSTM and it achieved more than 80+% accuracy for all.
