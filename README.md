# Computer Vision based Geolocation

This project implements a computer vision-based geolocation system that utilizes deep learning techniques and transfer learning with the ResNet architecture. The system aims to accurately predict the longitude and latitude coordinates of a location based on input images, providing a powerful tool for geolocation and mapping applications.

## Introduction


Hate speech is a pervasive issue cutting across borders and languages. It increases harmful, offensive behavior and negative phenomena on democratic platforms . Manual Filtering is not possible due to vast volume of data. Challenges in low-resource regional languages.
Urdu is widely used in South Asia.
More opportunity for making the results better.

 So, build this model to detect the hate and offense in text/sentences.



## Dataset

The dataset used in this is extracted from youtube comments and some from E-shopping sies feedback and all files are present in this repository 

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for computer vision based geolocation is transfer learning. We Mobile net and fine tuned by adding a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer with the desired number of output units

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv-based-geolocation.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the specific Notebook you want to use

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated on test data using different classic ML models and also using LSTM and it achieved more than 80+% accuracy for all.
